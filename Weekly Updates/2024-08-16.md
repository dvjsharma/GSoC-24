# Week 12 meeting and activities

_(August 16,2024)_

## Attendees

-   [Divij Sharma](https://github.com/dvjsharma)
-   [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
-   [Valens Niyonsenga](https://github.com/valens200)

## Discussion

-   Updated on the development status of the project. Everything, expect the OAuth 2.0 authentication (need some changes), is completed.

-   Issues tracking the progress of REST API upgrade are still open, they can safely be closed now as the work is completed and merged. [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx) will take care of this.

-   Since the API migration is done, we should have some sort of `sunset` header in the version 1 API response to inform the users about the deprecation. This can be merged when we are ready to release the new API.

## Activities

-   Added a `deprecation` and `sunset` header in the version 1 API response.
