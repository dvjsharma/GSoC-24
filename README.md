## Overview

<p align="justify">
In recent years, FOSSology's REST APIs have expanded significantly, enhancing user accessibility, flexibility, and automation. However, the development is not yet complete, prompting some users to resort to mocking WebUI access solely for information retrieval. With the development of FOSSology's new React UI also underway, robust support for REST APIs becomes imperative. This project aims to finalize the development of FOSSology's REST API by exposing any remaining endpoints, enhancing and upgrading existing ones to V2, increasing test coverage, and improving documentation. The approach involves a comprehensive review of each module to ensure the availability and exposure of required APIs for frontend consumption. These efforts will streamline development workflows, enhancing the overall usability of the FOSSology platform and facilitating the development of the new React UI.

<h1 align = "center" id = "contributions">üöÄ Contributions</h1>

During my participation in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, I focused on implementing and enhancing the following key features in the project:

1. ### Development of REST API upgrade guidelines:

    <p align="justify">
    I developed a comprehensive REST API upgrade guideline in preparation for the transition to version 2. This guideline was crucial in clearly defining the upgrade objectives and ensuring a smooth and effective process. The guideline is live on <a href="https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2024/rest/API-guidelines">this</a> link.
    </p>

2. ### Upgradation of REST APIs to Version 2:

    <p align="justify">
    I utilized this guideline to successfully upgrade the existing REST APIs to version 2, ensuring that all enhancements aligned with the predefined objectives and delivered a more robust and efficient API framework.
    </p>

3. ### Development of new endpoints:

    <p align="justify">
    I introduced several new endpoints to extend the platform's functionality. These new endpoints were designed to meet evolving user needs, streamline workflows, and provide more comprehensive access to the system's features, further enhancing the overall user experience. Also, since the new React UI is under development, these endpoints will also help in extending the backend functionality and removing the dependency on mocking WebUI access.
    </p>

4. ### Improving test coverage:

    <p align="justify">
    I worked with my colleague <a href="https://github.com/valens200">Valens</a> to improve the test coverage for existing functionalities and develop new test cases for new functionalities.
    </p>

5. ### Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication:

    <p align="justify">
    I exposed new endpoints to enable OAuth authentication over the APIs following the client credentials flow (for developers) and authorization code grant flow (for the new UI). This addition included authentication logic change in the backend.
    </p>

    _In the similar way, `email`, `url` and `author` endpoints can also be tested._

4. Developed new endpoints to provide JSON format import and export of licenses and obligations via APIs

    - [feat(api): JSON format export/import of licenses and obligations via APIs](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2804)

    Send a `GET` request to `/license/export-json` to test the license export functionality in JSON format.

    Send a `POST` request to `/license/import-json` along with JSON file to import licenses.

    Send a `POST` request to `/obligations/import-json` along with JSON file to import obligations.

5. Modified the `/jobs` and related endpoints to provide more detailed information about the jobs and their status. Now, all the child jobs are included in the response, and the job status of each parent job is confined to all of its child jobs status exclusively. Additionally, the `/jobs/history` endpoint is deprecated in favour of the `/jobs` endpoint (in can be tweaked to get the history of jobs).

    - [feat(api): modify /jobs and related endpoints](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2781)

    For every distinct job, the `/jobs` endpoint now includes all the associated child jobs along with their detailed information.

    ![image](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/119073504/269cb785-f120-4f5d-8744-e57a1b1abc49)

    The job status of each parent job is confined to its child job scope exclusively. If any other child job fails for the same upload, it won't affect the status of the current job.

## Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication üë®‚Äçüíª :

<p align="justify">
In this milestone, I enhanced FOSSology server by adding new and improved API endpoints for OIDC configuration, making the server fully configurable via APIs. It also introduces support for the Client Credentials Grant (M2M) flow over APIs, allowing automated systems to authenticate and interact with FOSSology. Additionally, new endpoints enable the Authorization Code Grant flow, allowing web applications like FOSSologyUI to securely authenticate users and obtain access tokens. The same can be tested using the <a href="https://github.com/dvjsharma/OAuthFossy">OAuthFossy</a> web app.
</p>

#### Client Credentials

1. Added a new endpoint: `/users/oauthclient` to add a new OAuth client when the user is logged in.
    <div align = "center">
    <img src="https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/119073504/d4ba2abd-9430-4c60-87d8-36c7ecf04b58" width="80%"/>
    </div>

2. Added a new endpoint: `/users/oauthclient/{type}` to get active and expired OAuth clients.
    <div align = "center">
    <img src="https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/119073504/e2508ab4-8762-40ba-8dca-fa659adb9acf" width="80%"/>
    </div>

3. The `/customise` endpoint used to accept only a single key-value pair for updating admin configs, making it difficult to update fields in bulk. I've modified it to accept an array of key-value pairs and update accordingly. This change is done in version 2 APIs to maintain backward compatibility.

4. The `/customise` endpoint is now capable to fetch all other URLs required for OIDC integration automatically when the discovery URL is passed over the REST API.

#### Authorisation Code Grant

1. Added a new endpoint: `/oauth/login` to get the authorisation redirect URL. Client can redirect user to this URL where the user (resource owner) can grant access to their profile via OpenID.
    <div align = "center">
    <img src="https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/119073504/7817b762-a96f-437c-94b6-3e348d73e87a" width="80%"/>
    </div>

2. Added a new endpoint: `/oauth/callback` to exchange authorisation code with an access token. Once the user grants access to the resources, a `state` and `code` is generated which is later exchanged for an access token via this endpoint.
    <div align = "center">
    <img src="https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/119073504/ff2d932a-0444-4ad1-9f23-bac2271e7022" width="80%"/>
